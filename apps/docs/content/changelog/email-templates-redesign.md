We've completely redesigned all transactional email templates to match the dashboard's dark theme aesthetic. Emails now feature the proper Databuddy logo, consistent colors synced directly from our design system, and a cleaner layout without unnecessary visual clutter.

All email templates—verification, magic link, OTP, password reset, and team invitations—now share a unified look with the inline SVG logo, proper color palette (#111114 background, #1a1a1d card, #3030ed brand), and improved fallback link sections that are actually clickable.

We also added graceful handling for edge cases like team members without display names, ensuring invitation emails always show "A team member" instead of awkward empty text.
