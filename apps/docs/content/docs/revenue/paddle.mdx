Connect Paddle payments to Databuddy's analytics to track revenue from your SaaS products. Paddle acts as a merchant of record, handling taxes and compliance automatically.

## Overview

The Paddle integration captures:
- **Transactions**: Track completed payments and checkouts
- **Subscriptions**: Monitor recurring revenue
- **Revenue Metrics**: Net revenue, refunds, and transaction trends

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open Revenue Settings in Databuddy

1. Go to your website in the Databuddy dashboard
2. Navigate to **Revenue** in the sidebar
3. Click the **Configure** button in the top right
4. Click on the **Paddle** section to expand it

</Step>
<Step>

### Copy the Webhook URL

In the Revenue settings sheet, you'll see a unique webhook URL for Paddle:

```
https://basket.databuddy.cc/webhooks/paddle/your_unique_hash
```

Click the copy button next to the URL to copy it to your clipboard.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create a Notification in Paddle

1. Go to [vendors.paddle.com/notifications](https://vendors.paddle.com/notifications)
2. Click **New destination**
3. In the **URL** field, paste your Databuddy webhook URL
4. Under **Events**, select:

**Required events** (must be selected):
- `transaction.completed`

**Optional events** (recommended):
- `transaction.billed`

5. Save the notification destination

</Step>
<Step>

### Copy the Webhook Secret

After creating the notification:

1. Find your notification destination in the list
2. Copy the webhook secret (it starts with `pdl_ntfset_`)

</Step>
<Step>

### Paste the Secret in Databuddy

1. Return to the Revenue settings sheet in Databuddy
2. In the **Signing secret** field under Paddle, paste your webhook secret
3. Click **Save**

The Paddle section will now show a checkmark indicating it's configured.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Testing

### Paddle Sandbox

To test your Paddle integration without processing real payments:

1. Use the Paddle sandbox environment when creating the webhook
2. Create test transactions in the sandbox
3. Check the Databuddy Revenue page after processing test transactions

<Callout type="info">
  Test transactions may take a few moments to appear in your Databuddy dashboard after the webhook is received.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appearing

If revenue data isn't showing after setup:

1. **Verify webhook is active** - Check your Paddle dashboard to ensure the notification destination shows successful deliveries
2. **Check the signing secret** - Make sure you copied the complete secret including the `pdl_ntfset_` prefix
3. **Process a test transaction** - Create a test payment to trigger a webhook event

### Webhook Delivery Failures

If Paddle shows failed webhook deliveries:

- Verify the webhook URL is correct
- Ensure the signing secret in Databuddy matches exactly
- Check that you selected the required events

### Missing Events

If some transactions aren't appearing:

- Verify all required events are selected in Paddle
- Check if the transactions occurred after the webhook was configured
- Historical transactions before webhook setup won't be captured
