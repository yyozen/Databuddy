Track revenue automatically from your payment providers. Databuddy receives webhook events from Stripe, Paddle, and Autumn to give you real-time revenue analytics including net revenue, subscriptions, refunds, and transaction trends.

<Callout type="info">
  Revenue tracking requires no code changes to your application. Simply configure webhooks in your payment provider dashboard and paste the signing secret in Databuddy.

## Overview

The Revenue page in your Databuddy dashboard shows:

- **Net Revenue** - Total revenue minus refunds
- **Gross Revenue** - Total revenue before refunds
- **Subscriptions** - Recurring revenue and active subscription count
- **Refunds** - Refund amounts and count
- **Transaction Trends** - Revenue over time with interactive charts
- **Average Transaction Value** - Per-transaction revenue breakdown

## Understanding Revenue Metrics

### Net Revenue vs Gross Revenue

- **Gross Revenue** is the total amount of successful payments
- **Net Revenue** is gross revenue minus refunds
- Use net revenue for accurate business reporting

### Subscription vs One-time Revenue

Databuddy automatically categorizes transactions based on the payment type:

- **Subscriptions** - Recurring payments from subscription products
- **One-time Sales** - Single purchase transactions

### Refund Tracking

Refunds are tracked automatically when you process them through your payment provider. The dashboard shows:

- Total refund amount
- Number of refunds
- Impact on net revenue

## Regenerating Webhook URLs

If you need to regenerate your webhook URLs (for example, if your URL was compromised):

1. Open the Revenue settings sheet
2. Click **Regenerate webhook URLs** at the bottom
3. Update the webhook URL in your payment provider dashboard
4. Your old webhook URLs will stop working immediately

<Callout type="warn">
  After regenerating URLs, you must update the endpoint URL in your payment provider dashboard. Webhooks sent to old URLs will fail.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appearing

If revenue data isn't showing after setup:

1. **Verify webhook is active** - Check your payment provider dashboard to ensure the webhook endpoint shows successful deliveries
2. **Check the signing secret** - Make sure you copied the complete secret including any prefix
3. **Process a test transaction** - Create a test payment to trigger a webhook event
4. **Check webhook logs** - Look for failed delivery attempts in your provider's dashboard

### Webhook Delivery Failures

If your payment provider shows failed webhook deliveries:

- Verify the webhook URL is correct
- Ensure the signing secret in Databuddy matches exactly
- Check that you selected the required events

### Missing Events

If some transactions aren't appearing:

- Verify all required events are selected in your payment provider
- Check if the transactions occurred after the webhook was configured
- Historical transactions before webhook setup won't be captured
