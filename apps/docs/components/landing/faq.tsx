		question: 'How is Databuddy different from Google Analytics?',
		answer:
			"Databuddy is built for privacy-first analytics with no cookies required, making it GDPR and CCPA compliant out of the box. Our script is 65x faster than GA4, with a <1KB footprint that won't impact your Core Web Vitals.",
	},
	{
		question: 'Do I need to add cookie consent banners?',
		answer:
			"No. Databuddy's analytics are completely cookieless, using privacy-preserving techniques to provide accurate analytics without tracking individual users. Our customers typically see a 30% increase in conversion rates after removing those intrusive cookie banners.",
	},
	{
		question: "What's included in the free plan?",
		answer:
			"Our free plan includes up to 10,000 monthly events, real-time analytics, basic event tracking, It's perfect for small websites, personal projects, or to test Databuddy before upgrading.",
	},
	{
		question: 'How easy is it to implement Databuddy?',
		answer:
			"Implementation takes less than 5 minutes for most websites. Simply add our lightweight script to your site (we provide easy integrations for Next.js, React, WordPress, Shopify, and more), and you'll start seeing data immediately.",
