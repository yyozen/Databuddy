							Our Tracking Script
						</h2>
						<p className="mb-4">
							When someone visits your website, our lightweight script
							(delivered via Bunny.net's global CDN) springs into action. It
							automatically sends us a pageview event with basic information
							about the visit.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							The browser naturally sends us the visitor's IP address and
							User-Agent string (which tells us their browser and operating
							system). We also send the page URL they visited, where they came
							from (referrer), and your project token to know which website this
							visit belongs to.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							Our script doesn't set cookies and sends only anonymous pageview
							and event data. We never collect personal information or identify
							individual users.
						</p>
						<div className="my-4 rounded border border-accent bg-accent/50 p-4">
							<p className="text-sm">
								<strong className="text-primary">Privacy Respect:</strong> If a

								their browser, our script won't send analytics events.

							Since we don't collect personal data, no consent is required. For

							Security and Protection
						</h2>
						<p className="mb-4">
							Before we process any visitor data, every request goes through our
							security checks. We automatically detect and filter out bot
							traffic using industry-standard bot detection. This keeps your
							analytics clean and accurate.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We also implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. If an IP address
							makes too many requests in a short period, we temporarily block
							it. This is the only time we store IP addresses. These records
							automatically expire and are never used for anything beyond that.
						</p>
						<div className="my-4 rounded border border-accent bg-accent/50 p-4">

								<strong className="text-primary">Note:</strong> Once a request

							What We Collect
						</h2>
						<p className="mb-4">
							To count unique visitors without cookies or persistent tracking,
							we create what we call an "anonymous signature" for each visitor.
						</p>

						<h3 className="mb-3 font-semibold text-xl">
							How Anonymous Signatures Work
						</h3>
						<p className="mb-4">
							Here's exactly how it works. We take the visitor's IP address,
							their User-Agent string, your project token, and each project's
							unique daily salt that rotates at midnight. We combine these into
							a string and run it through SHA-256 hashing, creating a completely
							anonymous identifier that looks something like{" "}
							<code className="rounded bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5 text-sm">
								a7b2c9d4e5f6...
							</code>
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							Unless you have trillions of dollars, this hash is practically
							impossible to reverse back to the original IP address. Even if
							someone had our database, they couldn't figure out who visited
							your site. And because the salt changes daily, each anonymous
							visitor gets a completely different signature each day.
						</p>

						<h3 className="mb-3 font-semibold text-xl">IP Address Handling</h3>
						<p className="mb-4">
							What happens to the IP address? We use it for one last thing. We
							look up the visitor's approximate location. Once we get the
							location data, we immediately discard the IP address. It's never
							stored anywhere.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							Instead of storing precise coordinates like other analytics
							providers, we only store the city, region, country, and geoname
							ID. When we do need coordinates, we derive the city center
							coordinates from this ID. This means two people on opposite sides
							of New York for example will both show up at the exact same
							coordinates. They both appear at the center of New York.
