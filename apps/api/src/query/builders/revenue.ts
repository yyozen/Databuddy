/**
 * Revenue Attribution CTE Pattern
 *
 * Attribution uses a multi-level fallback approach:
 * 1. session_id match (most accurate, when available)
 * 2. anonymous_id match (fallback for transactions with tracked users)
 * 3. Time-based "last touch" attribution (fallback: attribute to the last 
 *    pageview that occurred before/on the purchase date)
 *
 * Transactions without any matches are labeled "Unattributed"
